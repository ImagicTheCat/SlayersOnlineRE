This file is about how all the game data is managed.

== Resources streaming

All game's persistent resources are located in the `resources/` path, which is a combination of multiple origins.

.Resource origins in reverse order
base game files:: base/default files
`resources_repository/` game data files (streaming):: resources acquired from the remote repository
`resources/` game data files:: can be used to customize the game resources

Not all resources are remote-requested before being used.

== Skins

Skins are loaded from the skin repository when needed and are not saved.
